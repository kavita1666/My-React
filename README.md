# My React Library

## Overview

This project focuses on creating our own React library to understand how React works under the hood. The library includes a custom React-DOM tree capable of handling various types of React elements.

## Technologies Used

- React (Custom implementation)
- Parcel (Used as the bundler for fast and efficient builds)

## Features

The custom React-DOM tree can handle react elements of the following types:

- Arrays (e.g., [div, span, p])
- Strings (e.g., div, span, p)
- React elements with type as a function (e.g., <App />), supporting:
    - props as an object
    - props as an array
    - props as children elements
    - nested children elements


## Usage

Import and use the custom React library components in your project as needed.
